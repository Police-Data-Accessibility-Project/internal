## Stage of Development

This venture started up in early May 2020 out of an established Slack-GitHub-Discord-Reddit community of contributors. Volunteer activity peaked and waned, and now we're a small group of dedicated volunteers growing at a more stable pace.

## Contribute code

Most code contributed to PDAP is in the form of scrapers which gather data, or ETLs which process it. For instructions and guidelines, reference the [list of open and recurring tasks](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jKUXUkXXvFdE_2NOqijTx4E58-qhN13DT3yBA6CepjU/edit#gid=470918453) pulled from our Jira environment.
