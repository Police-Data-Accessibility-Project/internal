# Police Data Accessibility Project
PDAP aims to be a Source of Truth for police data. [This is where we're headed](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RpGeyYXKmBdieRhgdBJcabOr5rsHkdRyrFwFpu0Y59E).

# Getting Started
1. If you're new, [go here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Wjvv0NT3eECATJ4r8GQwEgS-sPqYFW8IGC8jvn3Bu5o/edit?usp=sharing) to see what we're doing and how you might fit in. We need help from people who don't code, too!
2. If you'd like to contribute code, you'll need to make sure Keybase knows about your github username. [Submit that here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdaeDqci4eQwpIg-XUu64Qrf3zzQEx_MbV0S7DHVaiJoHWT-Q/viewform?usp=sf_link).
